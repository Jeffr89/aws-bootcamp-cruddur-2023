# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS

To avoid AWS service cost I will use the AWS account of my company. I will try to keep two different AWS account, splitting services based on free or cost one.

For this reason I couldnâ€™t setup in an easy way the security group rules automatic update. 
Iâ€™ll try to figure out how to use 2 different AWS account in the same workspace ðŸ™‚

Going thought the course Iâ€™ve found out that is nearly impossible to continue with 2 account (for example for the VPC constraint related of RDS and Lambda. I switched back to a single aws account. To decrease the bill Iâ€™ve added several script into gitpod.yaml file to turn on and off the RDS DB automatically.

Iâ€™ve directly used the AWS CLI to execute different aws cli commands.
