# Week 3 ‚Äî Decentralized Authentication
I‚Äôve completed all the standard to do task.

### Decouple JWT Verify - Middleware

I‚Äôve decoupled the JWT verify from the application code writing a middleware ***authz.py*** inside the middleware folder. I‚Äôve coded a wrapper called ***cognito_verify_jwt_with_token.***
I‚Äôve wrapped the */api/activities/notifications* route to test it, in that way I haven‚Äôt modified the */api/activities/home* implementation done during the live stream.
I‚Äôve also modified the front-end part ************************NotificationFeedPage.js************************ to pass the authorization token and to check if the user is authorized.
Everything works üôÇ

### Decouple JWT Verify - Container Sidecar

Never used NodeJS and ExpressJS. Something cool to learn üôÇ

Created a folder called `jwt-verify-sidecar` containing the container sidecar that implement the JWT verification using the **********aws-jwt-verify********** library.

Implemented 2 different API to test both method: GET with token passeed through header or POST to verify the token passed via json body.
Both can be found inside `server.js` that contains the node express js server.

After testing ******locally******, I‚Äôve dockerized the container and added the configuration in the docker-compose file too.

Dockerfile:

```docker
FROM node:16.18

ENV PORT=9001

COPY . /jwt-verify-sidecar
WORKDIR /jwt-verify-sidecar
RUN npm install
EXPOSE ${PORT}
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

Than i created a middleware called `cognito_verify_jwt_via_sidecar_given_token` inside the ***********middleware*********** folder.
I‚Äôve duplicated the */api/activities/notifications* to test the new middleware.

```python
@app.route("/api/activities/notifications", methods=['GET'])
@cognito_verify_jwt_via_sidecar_given_token(cognito_jwt_token, app)
def data_notifications():
  data = NotificationsActivities.run()
  return data, 200
```

Everything works. 

### Decouple JWT Verify - Envoy

It has been an hard task.
Never used Envoy so I had to read the docs and tried to figure out how it works.
Fewer hours later, and much more Google and ChatGPT prompt, I figured out how to implement it. üôÇ

I‚Äôve created a new folder called *****envoy***** that contains the envoy‚Äôs configuration yaml file.
Than I added the envoy service in the docker compose file.

I used Envoy as a proxy between front-end and back-end to validate the JWT token.
I‚Äôve tested it with the ************************NotificationFeedPage.js,************************ duplicating the */api/activities/notifications,* commenting the old one.
To use the Envoy container as proxy I had to modify the `backend_url` with the new envoy url, passed as env variable.

Everything works. üôÇ

### Implement a IdP login eg. Login with Facebook

This is hardest task in my opinion.

I‚Äôve configured the Facebook App and the facebook login via facebook dev console: 

![idpfacebook](./img/w31.png)

Than configured the Identity Provider on AWS Cognito:

![idpfacebook](./img/w32.png)

Via the following link is possible to authenticate via Facebook IDP:

https://cruddur.auth.eu-central-1.amazoncognito.com/login?response_type=code&client_id=5nvou0p7c39cbhvhjad9sm4ud5&redirect_uri=https://3000-jeffr89-awsbootcampcrud-ypj7wgkcewv.ws-eu93.gitpod.io/

It correctly add the user in the pool.

Than the auth return to the Cruddur homepage with the ‚Äúaccess code‚Äù that I had converted via a Cognito API into the JWT of the user as visible in the console log.

![idpfacebook](./img/w34.png)

Right now I‚Äôm using the random domain name of gitpod so It is necessary to update the URL on Facebook Dev console and AWS cognito console every time I restart the workspace.

I will update it soon with a custom domain for the cruddur app.

Unfortunately I can‚Äôt go on with the implementation. I‚Äôm stuck during the implementation of the front-end part cause my low react knowledge.
